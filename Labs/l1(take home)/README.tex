\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Task - 1}
Run the file named \texttt{Task1.py} and enter the input in the format \\ \texttt{B1 B2 B3 B4 B5} \\
This should result in the following output \\\texttt{B1 -> B5 -> B2 -> B4 -> B3}\\
Note that the file named \texttt{singlylinkedlist.py} is a part of \texttt{Task1.py} and that is from where the SinglyLinkedList class to store the data is imported from.
\subsection{Task - 2}
Run the file named \texttt{Task2.py} and enter an integer as the input...\\Note that we have imported the class \texttt{SinglyLinkedList} from the \texttt{singlylinkedlist.py} and creating an object \texttt{bookmark\_set} to store the values and to check...\\ Supposing we enter \texttt{19} it outputs \texttt{True} and for another input like \texttt{1098} it outputs \texttt{False}
